# OCP - Opcache Control Panel

![OCP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlazarov/ocp/master/screenshot-01.png)

### Usage

Download ocp.php and point your browser to the file.


### Known problems/Limitations:
Unlike APC, the Zend OPcache API
 - cannot determine when a file was put into the cache
 - cannot change settings on the fly
 - cannot protect opcache functions by restricting execution to only specific scripts/paths

### Todo:
- Extract variables for prefered ordering and better layout instead of just dumping into tables
- File list filter
